Exposing the cracks in the system.

## ðŸ“œ Overview
FaultLine is a powerful, modular penetration testing and reconnaissance framework designed to identify and exploit the "fault lines" in networks and systems. It combines robust enumeration, vulnerability discovery, and exploitation features into a single tool to help red teams and pentesters achieve their goals.

FaultLine thrives on finding the smallest cracksâ€”misconfigurations, weak points, and overlooked vulnerabilitiesâ€”and gradually widening them to gain a foothold and escalate access.

## ðŸš€ Features
### Network Enumeration
Scans and maps out hosts, services, and open ports.
Tracks weak spots across nodes in real-time.
### Exploit Automation
Built-in payload generation and delivery for common exploits.
Seamless integration with tools like sqlmap, wpscan, and hydra.
### Vulnerability Discovery
Automated checks for misconfigurations, outdated software, and exploitable services.
Manual injection points for fine-tuned testing.
### Brute Force Integration
Target services like cPanel, FTP, SSH, and more.
Custom wordlist support for precision attacks.
### OSINT Enhancements
Subdomain enumeration and DNS footprinting.
Extract metadata from targeted websites.
### Customization
Fully scriptable modules to expand functionality.
Adjustable threading for faster scans.
